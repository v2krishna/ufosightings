# UFOs

## Purpose of The Project: 
Build a Dynamic Web Page using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootcstrap components for storing the UFO sighting across different countries. Help users to interact with the Wegpage by search on either Date, City, State, Country and Shape of the UFO's sighted

### Results and How to use the Webpage:
The webpage consists three parts,
#### Overview of UFO:
  Describes the UFO sighting infomation at a high level. This is static information which wont change much until someone changes the content in the HTML.

#### Tabular Data:<br>
  Contains the UFO Sightings that has been happened in different cities,states, shapes of UFOs and the date of the sightings happened.
#### Filter Criteria:
  Filter Criteria section helps the users to interact with the page and get the information they are related interested. In the below example we are entering "ca" canada country     in the input text next to the "Enter a Country" , the table on the right of the Filter Section will display only the sightings that happened in Canada. <br>

  Similarly if we want to search for the sightings happened in fl state, you can type "fl" in the input text, next to the "Enter a State" , the table gets updated with the           sightings that happened in Florida State.
